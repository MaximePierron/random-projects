Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my Ma and Pa
Not the way that I do love you

Well, holy molly me oh my
You're the apple of my eye
Girl, I never loved one like you

Man, oh, man, you're my best friend
I scream it to the nothingness
There ain't nothing that I need

Well, hot and heavy pumpkin pie
Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
Ain't nothing please me more than you

Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

La la la la
Take me home
Mama, I'm coming home

I'll follow you into the park
Through the jungle, through the dark
Girl, I never loved one like you

Moats and boats, and waterfalls
Alleyways, and pay phone calls
I've been everywhere with you (that's true)

Laugh until we think we'll die
Barefoot on a summer night
Never could be sweeter than with you

And in the streets you run a free
Like it's only you and me
Jeez, you're something to see

Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you

La la la la
Take me home
Daddy, I'm coming home

‒ Jade?
‒ Alexander?
‒ Do you remember that day you fell outta my window?
‒ I sure do - you came jumping out after me.
‒ Well, you fell on the concrete, nearly broke your ass, and you were bleeding all over the place, and I rushed you out to the hospital, you remember that?
‒ Yes, I do.
‒ Well, there's something I never told you about that night.
‒ What didn't you tell me?
‒ Well, while you were sitting in the back seat smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last, I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you 'til just now!

Oh, home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is where I'm alone with you

Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Our home, yes, I am home
Home is when I'm alone with you

Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my Ma and Pa
Moats and boats, and waterfalls
Alleyways, and payphone calls

(Oh home) Home
(Oh home) Home
Home is wherever I'm with you!
(Oh home) Home
(Oh home) Home
Home is wherever I'm with you!
